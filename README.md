# Hotchkiss Dining Hall App
 The Hotchkiss Dining Hall (HDH) App is year long project created by my friend and I that allows members of the Hotchkiss community to be well informed regarding the dining hall menu through a mobile app. The app also allows other feautres, such as menu filter, star rating, and giving overall feedbacks on each meal.

This project is done on xcode 10.0, swift 4.0, and should be run on an iPhone 8/iPhone 7 simulator
